## About FLISoL

FLISoL is the largest Free Software transmission event in Latin America and is intended for all audiences: students, academics, employers, workers, government officials, fans and even people who do not have computer skills.

Entry into the FLISoL is free and its main purpose is to promote the use of free software, making known to the general public its philosophy, scope, progress and development.

The event is organized by the various free software local communities and developed simultaneously with events in which it is installed, for free and completely legal software. Moreover, in parallel, lectures, presentations and workshops around Free Software in all its range of expressions are offered.
